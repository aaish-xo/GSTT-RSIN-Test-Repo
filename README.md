# GSTT-RSIN-Test-Repo
## A test repository for the GSTT RSIN project.

Aaisha/Sid - hopefully this will help with getting to grips with the basics of using Git for version control!

There are a lot of good articles explaining what Git is and how to use it ([this one](https://kinsta.com/knowledgebase/what-is-github/) is quite good). The basic idea is that we'll have a central repository of all of our files here. If any of us want to work on the files and/or make any changes, we'll download (or 'pull') a version of the repository onto our local computer, make the changes on this version, and then upload (or 'push') the changed version back to Github. 

There are a number of ways that you can interact with this repository on your computer. One option is entirely through the command line, which is what you might see in a lot of online tutorials. This can get reasonably complicated quite quickly, so for this project it might be easier to download and work with the GitHub desktop app ([here](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/overview/getting-started-with-github-desktop)). Whichever the method you decide to use, the workflow we'll follow is the same (as outlined [here](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/using-github/github-flow)).

Once I've added you both as collaborators for this test project, try and follow through these steps (they're based on the steps involved in this [example](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-use-git-and-github-in-a-team-like-a-pro/)).

1: Go onto the "Issues" tab at the top of the home page. Any of us can raise issues, or tasks, and assign them for one of us to handle. I've created a simple demo issue for each of you, which is to alter the contents of the text file 'testText_*yourname*'.

2: Clone the whole repository on your own computer (to make a local copy). You'll only have to do this once, at the beginning of the project. You'll make the alterations to the text file on this copy. As mentioned before, this could be done in the command line, but I recommend using GitHub desktop!

3: Create a new branch in the repository to work on the issue. This is best practice, as it's generally not a good idea to make changes directly to the main branch. Name it something like '1-alterTextFile_*yourname*', to make it traceable to the issue you're working on.

4: Ensure you're working on the most up-to-date version of the repository, by 'pulling' the latest version. In GitHub Desktop, this process may be called 'Fetch origin', but it means the same thing. Make the changes to your local copy of the text file, as indicated in the instructions in the issue. Commit the changes to your new branch.

5: Once done, push your changes back to the shared repository on Github.

6: Once your changes have been pushed to GitHub, create a pull request. This sends me an alert that you have made changes, and have requested they be merged onto the main branch.

7: I'll review the pull request, and merge your changes to the main branch (assuming all goes well!)
